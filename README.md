# MessageBird's OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documents
for [MessageBird's API](https://developers.messagebird.com/api/).

Specification files are organized into folders based on the API. Current version support only YAML.

## What is OpenAPI?

From the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification):

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

## Project Status

This project is currently in **BETA**. If you've identified a mismatch between MessageBird's API behavior and this
specification, [please open an issue](https://github.com/messagebird/openapi-specs/issues/new).
